# Managing Cloud Resources

- Web based
- Command line
- REST API - benefit here can interface with existing company tools

### Web Based Management
- Management via browser. Easy to learn
### Command Line Management
- Not as easy as web based
- Can use scripts to perform operations. Can be either CLI or powershell
- Cloud shell. Kind of like web based but a shell

### API Management
